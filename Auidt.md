--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Focus:
DOM - I will conduct myself in the workshop related to using DOM as i find doing is better than reading.
API and Nodejs - I will play around a bit more with APIs and using node to fetch them, there are several resources that allow you to code along and use APIs and such.
JS Fundementals - I will make a JS Rock paper sicissors game from scratch to gather the fundementals and test them out in a practical manor.

Overall I will try and make more of my own indipendent coding projects and get my hands on some coding without being in a team.
